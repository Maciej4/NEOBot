# NEOBot
 
This repository contains basic robot code with a Junit test used for Unity simulation of a robot.

## Simulator

The simulator used is the [2020FRCSim](https://github.com/Maciej4/2020FRCSim). Follow the directions [here](https://github.com/Maciej4/2020FRCSim/blob/master/docs/StarterGuide.md) for how to get started.

## Compatability

This version of NEOBot is compatible with 2020FRCSim V0.2.0. It is not compatible with any earlier versions of the 2020FRCSim due to communication changes.
